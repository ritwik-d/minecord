# minecord
Minecord is a system I made to link my minecraft server with discord. Using this, messages sent in the minecraft server show up in discord. 

1. Edit the config.yml file for your own discord server.
2. Make sure to run main.py in **the same directory** as your server.jar file
3. Make sure the java archive (.jar) file is named **exactly** server.jar
5. **Run main.py IN PLACE of running the server jar file** (i.e. java -jar minecraft_server.jar --nogui)

Enjoy!
